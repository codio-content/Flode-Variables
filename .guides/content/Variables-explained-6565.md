Variables are really important and, thankfully, pretty simple.

A variable is simply a named place to store a value. It could be a number, a string (coming soon) or other types of data.

Take a look at the Flode chart on the left. This shows and explains variable usage.

## Assigning
Once you assign variables a value, that value remains until you change it. Your expressions can reference other variables as you can see from the chart.

```javascript
fart = degc * 9 / 5 + 32
```

Here, our arithmetic expression is calculating the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit by converting the value stored in the degrees C variable `degc`.

## input0 and input1 are variables
You have now been working with the input variables `input0`, `input1` etc. 

These are, in fact, nothing more than variables. They store whatever value is input by your test data or by the challenge when it runs.
