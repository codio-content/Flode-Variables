Variables are really important and, thankfully, pretty simple.

A variable is simply a named place to store a value. It could be a number, a string (coming soon) or other types of data.

Take a look at the Flode chart on the left. This shows and explains variable usage.

## Assigning
Once you assign variables a value, that value remains until you change it. Your expressions can reference other variables as you can see from the chart.

```javascript
fahrt = degc * 9 / 5 + 32
```

Here, our arithmetic expression is calculating the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit by converting the value stored in the degrees C variable `degc`.

## Input blocks create variables
You have now been working with input blocks with names of your choosing.

These are, in fact, nothing more than variables. They store whatever value is input by your test data or by the challenge when it runs.  The name of the variable is the same as the name of the input block, and the variable is created when the input block is reached.
