You can use variables whenever you like. 

- In some cases, it might make your code easier to read that `input0` and `input1`.
- When you get on to the Loops Unit, you will *have* to create variables as you will see.

On the left is another example where we show 2 ways of doing the same thing. One way shows us working directly with `input0` and another shows us assigning `input0` to a variable `maximum` so it is clearer what it is doing.

This example actually gives you a preview of a 'Loop' You can step through this chart to see what it is doing. It's not that tricky.
