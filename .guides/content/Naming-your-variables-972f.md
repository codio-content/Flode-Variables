## Basic Naming Rules

1. A variable name cannot start with a number. For instance, `3x` or `1ctr` are invalid.
1. You can have numbers within a JavaScript variable name. `x1` or `color2` are valid.
1. You cannot have any of the following characters in a variable name : `*+\/!%^&()~"'{}[]|:;?<>`. Just don;t use any funny characters.
1. You can use the `_` (underscore) character, so `my_number` or `_myNumber` is valid.
1. Do not use spaces.
1. There are some reserved words you cannot use : `for`, `while`, `if`, `object`, `each` and a few more (any Javascript reserved words if you want to know).
1. You can use these words within or as a part of a variable name, so `objectColor` is fine.

## Reserved Words
You cannot give your variables the same name as certain Javascript statements. The following is a list of words you cannot use as variable names.

## Case sensitive
Finally, and importantly, JavaScript variable names are case-sensitive. `myNumber` is a different variable to `MyNumber` and `mynumber`.
